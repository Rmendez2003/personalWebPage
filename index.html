        <p><em>Computer Science and Cybersecurity Student at the University of Rhode Island</em></p> 
        <p>I am a computer science student at the University Of Rhode Island. I am minoring in cyber security as well.
          <br> I am most agile at using C++ and I am currently attempting to get more familiarized with some backend 
          <br> development which is why I decided to use my spare time to attempt to create this website and use it as my
          <br> portfolio while at the same time develop my frontend and backend skills.
